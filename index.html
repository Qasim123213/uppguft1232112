        <p>"Bad Boys for Life" (often associated with the phrase "Ride or Die") is the third installment in the "Bad
            Boys" film series, starring Will Smith as Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence as Marcus Burnett. In this
            action-comedy film, Mike and Marcus, two Miami detectives, team up once again to take down a ruthless
            assassin linked to Mike's past. As they face deadly threats and personal challenges, they rely on their
            strong bond and a new elite team to bring justice. The film blends humor, high-octane action, and a deep
            dive into friendship, loyalty, and redemption.</p>
